# **MLS Penalty Outcome Analysis (2008â€“2022)**

## Project Description
This project explores the dynamics of penalty events in Major League Soccer (MLS). By analyzing the frequency of penalties, their outcomes, and key influencing factors, we uncover valuable insights that inform strategies and decision-making in the game.
